the whole concept of how program worked could be simplified as : preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking
preprocessing is to read the header file and locate the function prototype and paste it into current program.
compiling is to convert source code to assembly code.
assembling is to convert assembly code to machine code A.K.A binary code.
link is to combine all these header code and function code together.
plaintext -- encryption -- ciphertext
caesar cipher is one encryption which adds each character with a pre-determined number into a new character.
function prototype is used as a teaser of function programed below main funcion.
on the end of each string, there is a "\0", AKA null to imply an end.
%i could use to directly convert string[i] to a corresponding ASCII index.
echo $? can return the int main() function value, which could be programmed previously as an error code.
